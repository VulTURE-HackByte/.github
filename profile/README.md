## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the VulTURE! This project aims to assist users in evaluating the safety of websites by identifying potential vulnerabilities present within them. With the integration of our tools, users can easily assess the security posture of their websites and take necessary actions to mitigate risks.

## Project Overview

The Vulture Security Assessment Project comprises three main repositories:

1. **VulTURE_Website**: This repository contains the frontend code for the website. Built using React, Zustand, and Auth0, the website provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with our tools and view security assessment reports.

2. **VulTURE_DB**: The backend system that powers the Website. VulTURE_DB provides necessary endpoints for storing and retrieving data related to security assessments conducted through our platform.

3. **VulTURE_ZAP**: A Flask server designed to analyze vulnerabilities in a given target website. VulTURE_ZAP serves as a crucial component in our toolset, enabling users to perform comprehensive security tests effortlessly.

## Key Features

- **Website Security Assessment**: Users can easily assess the security of their websites through our intuitive web interface.
  
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: VulTURE_ZAP helps users identify potential vulnerabilities in target websites, simplifying the process of penetration testing.

- **Seamless Integration**: The three repositories work together seamlessly to provide a unified platform for website security assessment.
